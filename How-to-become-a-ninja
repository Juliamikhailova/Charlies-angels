  <p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="www.codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the

    <ol>

  <p>The Recommended Step-by-Step Guide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Dress like a Ninja: 
      Timeless accessories are a must-have first step in becoming a ninja. 
      Black clothes are the international standard, and whilst a sleek and smooth material is preferred, coarser materials and patterned materials such as tweed are slowely creeping into style- just like the ninja's.</li>
      <li>2. Imagine Yourself as a Ninja: 
      The law of attraction applies strongly to this step. To summarise; if you imagine yourself as a ninja, you are more likely to become a ninja through the pooling of positive energy.</l
      <li> 3. Start Training</li>
      <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
    </ul>
